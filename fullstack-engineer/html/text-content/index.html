      <h1>HTML Text Content</h1>
      <p>
        Use HTML text content elements to organize blocks or sections of content placed between the
        opening and closing <b>body</b> tags.<br />
        Important for accessibility and SEO, these elements identify the purpose or structure of
        that content.

          <tr>
            <td>&lt;blockquote&gt;</td>
            <td>
              indicates that the enclosed text is an extended quotation. Usually, this is rendered
              visually by indentation (see Notes for how to change it).<br />
              A URL for the source of the quotation may be given using the cite attribute, while a
              text representation of the source can be given using the cite element.
            </td>

              provides the description, definition, or value for the preceding term (dt) in a
              description list (dl).

          <tr>
            <td>&lt;div&gt;</td>
            <td>
              generic container for flow content. It has no effect on the content or layout until
              styled in some way using CSS<br />
              (e.g. styling is directly applied to it, or some kind of layout model like Flexbox is
              applied to its parent element).

            <td>&lt;dl&gt;</td>
            <td>
              a description list.<br />
              The element encloses a list of groups of terms (specified using the dt element) and
              descriptions (provided by dd elements).<br />
              Common uses for this element are to implement a glossary or to display metadata (a
              list of key-value pairs).
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>&lt;dt&gt;</td>
            <td>
              specifies a term in a description or definition list, and as such must be used inside
              a dl element.<br />
              It is usually followed by a dd element; however, multiple &lt;dt&gt; elements in a row
              indicate several terms that are all defined by the immediate next dd element.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>&lt;figcaption&gt;</td>
            <td>
              represents self-contained content, potentially with an optional caption, which is
              specified using the figcaption element.<br />
              The figure, its caption, and its contents are referenced as a single unit.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>&lt;hr&gt;</td>
            <td>
              a thematic break between paragraph-level elements: for example, a change of scene in a
              story, or a shift of topic within a section.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>&lt;li&gt;</td>
            <td>
              represent an item in a list. It must be contained in a parent element: an ordered list
              (ol), an unordered list (ul), or a menu (menu).<br />
              In menus and unordered lists, list items are usually displayed using bullet points. In
              ordered lists, they are usually displayed with an ascending counter on the left, such
              as a number or letter.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>&lt;ol&gt;</td>
            <td>an ordered list of items â€” typically rendered as a numbered list.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>&lt;p&gt;</td>
            <td>
              a paragraph. Paragraphs are usually represented in visual media as blocks of text
              separated from adjacent blocks by blank lines and/or first-line indentation, but HTML
              paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related content, such as images or form
              fields.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>&lt;pre&gt;</td>
            <td>
              preformatted text which is to be presented exactly as written in the HTML file. The
              text is typically rendered using a non-proportional, or "monospaced, font.<br />
              Whitespace inside this element is displayed as written.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>&lt;ul&gt;</td>
